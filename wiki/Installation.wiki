Follow the steps outlined in the Processing Android Wiki at http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android#Instructions to install the Android SDK for your operating system
</p>
<p>
Check the Android version you've installed on your device (under Settings/About Phone/Android Version). Use this information to determine which Ketai library version you should use (Ketai version for Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 or Jelly Bean 4.1, vs. Ketai for Gingerbread 2.33 or Honeycomb 3.0) 
</p><p>
If you are running 4.0 or higher, you can always get the latest stable library release from within the Processing IDE, selecting Sketch/Add Library.../Import Library) and search for "Ketai". Click "Install" on the right to complete the process.
</p><p>
Android may have dependencies that are specific to your operating system, such as additional device drivers. If you are developing on Windows, follow the USB driver installation instructions available at http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html. If you are developing on Linux, follow the instructions for setting up your device for development at http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up
